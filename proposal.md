# Proposal of Game

## QuoteMyQuote
### Gameplay
I will be pulling down random quotes using an API. The player will then be able to utilize these quotes in testing their typing; displaying their WPM after **60 seconds**. In multiplayer, WPM will be displayed after **the last player has gone**.

### Planned Tech
- Getting quotes with a quote API
- HTML and CSS to display and style elements on screen
    - Maybe use bootstrap or another library
- Javascript to interact with elements
